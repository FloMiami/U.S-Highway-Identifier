# U.S-Highway-Identifier
This is a Java project where the user inputs a U.S interstate highway number and the program returns whether the interstate is a primary or auxiliary highway. It also indicates if the (primary) highway runs north/south or east/west.


Side note: Primary U.S. interstate highways are numbered 1-99. Odd numbers (like the 5 or 95) go
north/south, and evens (like the 10 or 90) go east/west. Auxiliary highways are numbered 100-
999, and service the primary highway indicated by the rightmost two digits. Thus, I-405 services
I-5, and I-290 services I-90.
